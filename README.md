## Gamified spaced repetition
___
This application is a **gamified education application**, functionally similar to Quizlet but also
builds upon the principles of **spaced repetition**. In this software, users will be presented with a question and the 
a bank of possible answers, and will need to **identify the correct answer**. 

To allow the answers presented to the user to be of a similar type,
card can be organized into decks. Within those decks, the answers to the question can be mixed with other cards to form
an answer bank,
so the user must be able to identify the correct answer.

I find existing spaced repetition to be very **technical** and thus require a strong
understanding of the underlying scheduling algorithm to make best use of them. In addition, they often require
users to evaluate their own performance on a card, which may lead to biases. This application
aims to eliminate that, while providing a fun experience for users.
