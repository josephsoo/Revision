## Gamified spaced repetition
___
This application is a **gamified education application**, functionally similar to Quizlet but also
builds upon the principles of **spaced repetition**. This project aims to blend elements
of learning tools like Quizlet and the spaced repetition learning technique, by having the users answer questions 
with a given question bank. In this software, users will be presented with a question and the possible answers, 
and will need to **match 
the correct answer to the given question**. 

To allow the answers presented to the user to be of a similar type ,
question-answer pairs can be organized into groups. Within those groups, other similar but inccorrect answers can be 
drawn and presented to the user.

Finally, users may combine groups into decks, so that they can study a specific topic.

I find existing spaced repetition to be very **technical**, and require a strong
understanding of the underlying scheduling algorithm to use them optimally. In addition, they require
users to evaluate their own performance, which may lead to biases. This application
aims to eliminate that.
